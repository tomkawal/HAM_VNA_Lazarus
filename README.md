# HAM_VNA_Lazarus
HAM VNA with some decent modifications to Open S11 files, display RLC equivalent circuit etc. 
Some additions: export SPICE model to clipboard on right click on RLC picture,
export of chart or RLC to clipboard on double-click.
This copy is compiled with Lazarus 3.0.4, hence inflated exe size from 2 to 20 MB. 
Compilation to 32 bit possible as long as original LAPACK wrap is used in attached DLL files. 
64 bit possible, if correlation wrap in 587.dll is recompiled, if original source (587.f) is obtained from Alex VE3NEA.
Tested with Win10 and compatibility settings are illustrated in PNG file: Run as admin and High DPI, System (Enhanced).
